# CO493 - Probabilistic Inference - Bayesian Optimisation Coursework

## Requirements

To install the requirements, use the following commands (with `python>=3.6` enabled by default):

```

## Assignments

All the descriptions of the tasks are described in the *jupyter notebook*: `bayesian_optimisation.ipynb`

## Important note 

You will be assigned a personal Gitlab repository, in which you will have do your assignment.
From that repo, each time you push a commit, you will be able to run some tests on LabTS.
Those tests will provide you feedback about the validity of your results.
